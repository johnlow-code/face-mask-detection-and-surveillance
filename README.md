# facial-mask-detection-and-surveillance
Real-time face mask detection with facial recognition. The program detects whether if someone is wearing a mask or not with the video stream. 
If a person is found to be not wearing any face mask, a snapshot of that person will be taken, and facial recognition will be done on the snapshot to identify the identity of the person.
The information will then be be added into a spreadsheert report.
The authorities may then use the information collected in the spreadsheet to send out a warnings to people who are caught not wearing any masks.
