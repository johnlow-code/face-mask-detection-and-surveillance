# facial-mask-detection-and-surveillance
Real-time facial mask detection with facial recognition. The program detects whether someone is wearing a mask or not with the camera stream. If a person is found to be not wearing a mask, a snapshot will be taken and the name of the person who is not wearing any mask will be identified and recorded in a csv report.
